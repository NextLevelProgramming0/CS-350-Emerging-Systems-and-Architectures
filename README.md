# CS-350-Emerging-Systems-and-Architectures

1) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

   In this course we learned about embedded systems, how they are used, and how they are created.  We learned how embedded systems are created by creating a thermastat prototype from scratch.  First, we had to get all the necessary parts in order to build the embedded system.  Next we had to program the raspberry pi so that code can be applied to the thermastat as we build it.  Lastly, we had to update and add versions of packages so that the overall project will be able to function properly, as  we had to add piece by piece of hardware and wiring for each specific function.  In the end, a thermostat was built with a off, heat, and cool mode that could set the point at which we want the temperature and sense the temperature around the thermostat.
3) What did you do particularly well?

   I was really great at understanding what was necessary for the code in the project including coding the LED Display, buttons, and LED Lights.
5) Where could you improve?

   Building the hardware parts got so confusing as the project went on.  To go backwards was to risk messing up the whole project because the hardware and the code were so deeply intertwined and the wiring became harder to see through the process.
7) What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

   An small understanding(In comparison to the bigger picture) of how micro parts of technology are created and how their functionality is coded.
9) What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

   The ability to critically understand and think through problems to come to solutions was a helpful skill to have developed in this course.
11) How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    I made the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following the instructions on creating the hardware without deviating unless I went through the process of testing and the hardware was the problem.  I also made the program maintainable,readable, and adaptable by keeping clean code with comments so that if I had to change anything or go back it wouldn't be hard to change the coding.
